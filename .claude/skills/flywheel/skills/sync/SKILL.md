name: sync
description: Detect and reconcile drift between a REASONS spec and the actual code — find entities/operations present in code but not the spec, and spec items not yet implemented, then update the spec (with confirmation) or flag the missing implementation. Use after code has evolved past its original spec.

# /flywheel:sync — bidirectional spec↔code reconciliation

Load the spec at `.claude/flywheel/specs/$ARGUMENTS.md` (or the most recent). Then compare it to the current code:

1. **Code → spec drift**: entities, fields, operations, or files that exist in the code but are not reflected in the spec's Entities / Operations / Structure.
2. **Spec → code gaps**: items the spec promises that are not implemented, or that diverge from the described Approach/Structure.

Report both lists. Then reconcile:
- For **code → spec drift** that is intended: update the spec to match reality (the spec is a living contract). Show the diff and get confirmation before writing.
- For **spec → code gaps**: flag them as unfinished work — candidates for a new `/flywheel:plan` → `/flywheel:work` pass. Do not silently delete spec items.

Principle (SPDD): when reality and the spec disagree, decide deliberately which one is right and fix *that* one — never let them drift apart silently.
