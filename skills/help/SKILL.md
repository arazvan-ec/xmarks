# /flywheel:help — onboarding & command map

Onboard the user to flywheel. Be friendly, concrete, and skimmable — not a wall of text. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a topic or a task, tailor the answer to it; otherwise give the full orientation below, in order.

## 1. What flywheel is — say it in 2–3 lines
A disciplined, self-verifying development loop. One unit of work flows through six gated phases — **spec → plan → work → verify → review → compound** — and inside `work` runs a tight *write-failing-test → implement → run → observe → fix* inner loop. Nothing advances on "seems right": `verify` runs the real app/tests, and each finished cycle deposits reusable lessons into a ledger that primes the next one.

It has a **second pillar** too: where the loop *builds* software, `/flywheel:process` + `/flywheel:run` let flywheel *operate* it — Claude runs recurring domain operations ("analyze a car") as the backend, following a fixed contract, persisting to the repo's own datastore, and maturing the contract each run. This is the [agent-native](https://every.to/go-agent-native) side.

## 2. The command map — show as a table
| Command | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| `/flywheel:loop <task>` | **Start here.** Runs the whole cycle end to end, gating between phases. |
| `/flywheel:brainstorm <idea>` | The idea is fuzzy — sharpen it into agreed requirements first. |
| `/flywheel:spec <feature>` | Write the contract + one machine-checkable success metric. |
| `/flywheel:plan <spec>` | Turn a signed spec into ordered tasks, each with its own check. |
| `/flywheel:work <task>` | Implement with the iterate-until-green inner loop. |
| `/flywheel:debug <symptom>` | Something's broken — reproduce → isolate → fix → add a regression test. |
| `/flywheel:verify` | Objective PASS/FAIL gate; runs the real app/tests. |
| `/flywheel:review <ref>` | Parallel correctness / security / performance review. |
| `/flywheel:compound` | Capture this cycle's decisions and gotchas into the ledger. |
| `/flywheel:recall <query>` | Look up a past decision/gotcha/pattern the ledger has, on demand. |
| `/flywheel:ship <title>` | Clean commit + push + PR. |
| `/flywheel:process <desc>` | Define an **agent-native process** — a reusable contract (fixed rules + output schema + persistence) for a recurring domain operation Claude runs as the backend. |
| `/flywheel:run <slug> [input]` | Run a defined process as the runtime — follow its rules, persist to the repo's datastore, mature the contract. |
| `/flywheel:autoloop <goal>` | Hands-off: iterate autonomously until a metric is met or a budget runs out. |
| `/flywheel:sync <spec>` | Reconcile drift between a spec and the code. |
| `/flywheel:update [vendored\|marketplace]` | Update flywheel itself in this repo (mode autodetected). |

## 3. How to pick a starting point
- Clear feature/task in mind → `/flywheel:loop <task>` (it pauses at each gate for your sign-off).
- Idea still fuzzy → `/flywheel:brainstorm <idea>`, then `/flywheel:spec`.
- Just fixing a bug → `/flywheel:debug <symptom>`.
- Want it fully autonomous → `/flywheel:autoloop <goal>` (define a measurable goal first).
- Want Claude to *operate* the repo (run a recurring domain operation, not build code) → `/flywheel:process <desc>` to define it, then `/flywheel:run <slug> <input>` to execute + persist.

## 4. Good to know
- **State lives in this project** under `.claude/flywheel/`: specs in `specs/`, process contracts in `processes/` + the data strategy `DATA.md`, run/cycle telemetry reports in `runs/`, plus the compounding ledger `LEARNINGS.md`. The `SessionStart` hook injects a relevance-scored, budgeted subset of recent lessons each session (matched to the current branch/files); anything it skips is one `/flywheel:recall <query>` away.
- **Live progress**: process runs and dev cycles materialize their steps as visible tasks (states updated at every transition) and keep a per-execution telemetry report in `runs/`, republished to a stable artifact URL — watch the ledger move instead of asking "how is it going". Fail-open: reporting never blocks execution.
- **Optional hard gate**: drop an executable `.claude/flywheel/gate.sh` (for example `npm test && npm run lint`). While it exists, the `Stop` hook blocks finishing a turn whenever it fails — so nothing is called "done" with checks red.
- Commands are namespaced `/flywheel:…` and also show up in `/help`.
- **Model routing by role**: the mechanical `verifier` runs on a fast/cheap model (Haiku); the judgment-heavy `reviewer-*` run on Sonnet. Change an agent's `model:` frontmatter to adjust, or `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` to override all.
- **`/flywheel:autoloop` self-checks itself**: before it keeps/discards an iteration or declares its target met, it dispatches the `evaluator` agent (Haiku) to re-run the metric command independently, rather than trusting its own self-report.
- **Token-usage visibility**: check `/usage` for spend by skill/subagent, `/goal` (no args) for turns/tokens on an active goal, and `/workflows` for live per-agent totals on a dynamic workflow. Pilot autonomous work (`/flywheel:autoloop`, workflows) on a small budget before scaling up, and match `/loop`/routine intervals to how often the underlying state actually changes.
- **Read-priming**: before reading a file, an advisory hook surfaces any ledger entries whose `files=` metadata names it — it never blocks the read, and stays silent when there's no match.
- **When to delegate**: in `work`, reading 4+ files → hand exploration to a subagent; touching 2+ non-trivial files → get a fresh-context review; ~20 tool calls deep without converging → pause and re-plan. Advisory guardrails against context bloat.

## 5. Offer to start
Finish by asking one question: **"What do you want to build, fix, or explore right now?"** Based on the answer, recommend the exact command. If the user says go, invoke it for them (for example, run `/flywheel:loop <task>`). Never launch a `loop`, `autoloop`, or `ship` command without explicit confirmation.
